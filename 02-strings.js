//this will not run because it is a mix of double and single quotes 


typeof 97 //operator that will allow you to pass in a value and it will tell you the type 

//strings can contain all types of text and special characters 

let quoteMix="hi! i am a number 9! " //this is still a string 

// quotes inside a quote
